	Abstract = {When two moving objects are presented in perfect alignment, but are not visible for the same amount of time, the briefer object will often be perceived as "lagging" the object of greater duration. Most investigations of this flash-lag effect (FLE) employ high velocity broadband stimuli, such as lines or dots with sharp boundaries and flashes with rapid onset and offset. We introduce a stimulus paradigm with narrow-band stimuli and measure the stimulus dependence of the FLE when basic stimulus parameters of spatio-temporal frequency and temporal duration are varied. We suggest that this dependence is consistent with the involvement of early visual mechanisms and interpret our results in the context of existing theories of the FLE. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Just-noticeable differences (jnd's) in velocity were measured as a function of reference velocity for central and peripheral vision. The velocity discrimination curves plotting jnd's in velocity, expressed as Weber fractions, as a function of reference velocity were U shaped at all eccentricities. Under almost every stimulus condition the increase in jnd in velocity with increasing eccentricity was significantly larger at low reference velocities than at high reference velocities. Consequently the shift toward higher velocities with increasing eccentricity was much clearer for the lower end of the velocity-discrimination curve than for the upper end. These results are in agreement with the predictions derived from the response characteristics of velocity-tuned cells. Control experiments involving direction discrimination have shown that the impossibility of making fine velocity judgments at high speeds is due not to too weak a contrast for the stimulus motion to be visible but to a limitation in the neural apparatus analyzing velocity.},

@article{Gerard-Mercier2016,
	Abstract = {UNLABELLED: The computational role of primary visual cortex (V1) in low-level perception remains largely debated. A dominant view assumes the prevalence of higher cortical areas and top-down processes in binding information across the visual field. Here, we investigated the role of long-distance intracortical connections in form and motion processing by measuring, with intracellular recordings, their synaptic impact on neurons in area 17 (V1) of the anesthetized cat. By systematically mapping synaptic responses to stimuli presented in the nonspiking surround of V1 receptive fields, we provide the first quantitative characterization of the lateral functional connectivity kernel of V1 neurons. Our results revealed at the population level two structural-functional biases in the synaptic integration and dynamic association properties of V1 neurons. First, subthreshold responses to oriented stimuli flashed in isolation in the nonspiking surround exhibited a geometric organization around the preferred orientation axis mirroring the psychophysical "association field" for collinear contour perception. Second, apparent motion stimuli, for which horizontal and feedforward synaptic inputs summed in-phase, evoked dominantly facilitatory nonlinear interactions, specifically during centripetal collinear activation along the preferred orientation axis, at saccadic-like speeds. This spatiotemporal integration property, which could constitute the neural correlate of a human perceptual bias in speed detection, suggests that local (orientation) and global (motion) information is already linked within V1. We propose the existence of a "dynamic association field" in V1 neurons, whose spatial extent and anisotropy are transiently updated and reshaped as a function of changes in the retinal flow statistics imposed during natural oculomotor exploration.

			  SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The computational role of primary visual cortex in low-level perception remains debated. The expression of this "pop-out" perception is often assumed to require attention-related processes, such as top-down feedback from higher cortical areas. Using intracellular techniques in the anesthetized cat and novel analysis methods, we reveal unexpected structural-functional biases in the synaptic integration and dynamic association properties of V1 neurons. These structural-functional biases provide a substrate, within V1, for contour detection and, more unexpectedly, global motion flow sensitivity at saccadic speed, even in the absence of attentional processes. We argue for the concept of a "dynamic association field" in V1 neurons, whose spatial extent and anisotropy changes with retinal flow statistics, and more generally for a renewed focus on intracortical computation.},

	Abstract = {Transmission of neural signals in the brain takes time due to the slow biological mechanisms that mediate it. During such delays, the position of moving objects can change substantially. The brain could use statistical regularities in the natural world to compensate neural delays and represent moving stimuli closer to real time. This possibility has been explored in the context of the flash lag illusion, where a briefly flashed stimulus in alignment with a moving one appears to lag behind the moving stimulus. Despite numerous psychophysical studies, the neural mechanisms underlying the flash lag illusion remain poorly understood, partly because it has never been studied electrophysiologically in behaving animals. Macaques are a prime model for such studies, but it is unknown if they perceive the illusion. By training monkeys to report their percepts unbiased by reward, we show that they indeed perceive the illusion qualitatively similar to humans. Importantly, the magnitude of the illusion is smaller in monkeys than in humans, but it increases linearly with the speed of the moving stimulus in both species. These results provide further evidence for the similarity of sensory information processing in macaques and humans and pave the way for detailed neurophysiological investigations of the flash lag illusion in behaving macaques.},

@article{Musseler02,
	Abstract = {Three experiments with 10 college students and 20 observers compared the size of three mislocalization errors: the Froehlich effect, the flash-lag effect, and representational momentum. In Experiment 1, a flash appeared either simultaneously with the onset, the mid-position, or the offset of the moving target. Observers then judged the position where the moving target was located when the flash appeared. Experiments 2 and 3 were exclusively concerned with localizing the onset and the offset of the moving target. When observers localized the position with respect to the point in time when the flash was presented, a clear mislocalization in the direction of movement was observed at the initial position and the mid-position. In contrast, a mislocalization opposite to movement direction occurred at the final position. When observers were asked to ignore the flash (or when no flash was presented at all), a reduced error (or no error) was observed at the initial position and only a minor error in the direction of the movement occurred at the final position, An integrative model is proposed, which suggests a common underlying mechanism, but emphasizes the specific processing components of the Froehlich effect, flash-lag effect, and representational momentum.

	Abstract = {In soccer games, an attacking player is said to be in an offside position if he or she is closer to the opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-to-last defender. It is an offence for the attacker to be in an offside position and in active play at the moment a fellow team member plays the ball. Assistant referees often make mistakes when judging an offside offence, probably because of optical errors arising from the viewing angle adopted by them (Oudejans, Verheijen, Bakker, Gerrits, Steinbrckner, Beek, 2000 Nature 404 33). Looking more closely at Oudejans et al's data, we show evidence that the flash-lag effect may contribute significantly to these mistakes. Participation of the flash-lag effect in assistant referees' misjudgments would take this perceptual phenomenon from laboratory setups to a real-life situation for the first time.},

	Abstract = {Smooth-pursuit eye movements transform 100 ms of visual motion into a rapid initiation of smooth eye movement followed by sustained accurate tracking. Both the mean and variation of the visually driven pursuit response can be accounted for by the combination of the mean tuning curves and the correlated noise within the sensory representation of visual motion in extrastriate visual area {MT}. Sensory-motor and motor circuits have both housekeeping and modulatory functions, implemented in the cerebellum and the smooth eye movement region of the frontal eye fields. The representation of pursuit is quite different in these two regions of the brain, but both regions seem to control pursuit directly with little or no noise added downstream. Finally, pursuit exhibits a number of voluntary characteristics that happen on short timescales. These features make pursuit an excellent exemplar for understanding the general properties of sensory-motor processing in the brain.},

	Abstract = {If an observer sees a flashed (briefly presented) object that is aligned with a moving target, the perceived position of the flashed object usually lags the perceived position of the moving target. This has been referred to as the flash-lag effect, and the flash-lag effect has been suggested to reflect how an observer compensates for delays in perception that are due to neural processing times and is thus able to interact with dynamic stimuli in real time. Characteristics of the stimulus and of the observer that influence the flash-lag effect are reviewed, and the sensitivity or robustness of the flash-lag effect to numerous variables is discussed. Properties of the flash-lag effect and how the flash-lag effect might be related to several other perceptual and cognitive processes and phenomena are considered. Unresolved empirical issues are noted. Theories of the flash-lag effect are reviewed, and evidence inconsistent with each theory is noted. The flash-lag effect appears to involve low-level perceptual processes and high-level cognitive processes, reflects the operation of multiple mechanisms, occurs in numerous stimulus dimensions, and occurs within and across multiple modalities. It is suggested that the flash-lag effect derives from more basic mislocalizations of the moving target or flashed object and that understanding and analysis of the flash-lag effect should focus on these more basic mislocalizations rather than on the relationship between the moving target and the flashed object.},

	Abstract = {{Predictive coding hypothesizes that the brain explicitly infers upcoming sensory input to establish a coherent representation of the world. Although it is becoming generally accepted, it is not clear on which level spiking neural networks may implement predictive coding and what function their connectivity may have. We present a network model of conductance-based integrate-and-fire neurons inspired by the architecture of retinotopic cortical areas that assumes predictive coding is implemented through network connectivity, namely in the connection delays and in selectiveness for the tuning properties of source and target cells. We show that the applied connection pattern leads to motion-based prediction in an experiment tracking a moving dot. In contrast to our proposed model, a network with random or isotropic connectivity fails to predict the path when the moving dot disappears. Furthermore, we show that a simple linear decoding approach is sufficient to transform neuronal spiking activity into a probabilistic estimate for reading out the target trajectory.}},

@article{Newsome88,
	Abstract = {{1. We investigated cells in the middle temporal visual area (MT) and the medial superior temporal area (MST) that discharged during smooth pursuit of a dim target in an otherwise dark room. For each of these pursuit cells we determined whether the response during pursuit originated from visual stimulation of the retina by the pursuit target or from an extraretinal input related to the pursuit movement itself. We distinguished between these alternatives by removing the visual motion stimulus during pursuit either by blinking off the visual target briefly or by stabilizing the target on the retina. 2. In the foveal representation of MT (MTf), we found that pursuit cells usually decreased their rate of discharge during a blink or during stabilization of the visual target. The pursuit response of these cells depends on visual stimulation of the retina by the pursuit target. 3. In a dorsal-medial region of MST (MSTd), cells continued to respond during pursuit despite a blink or stabilization of the pursuit target. The pursuit response of these cells is dependent on an extraretinal input. 4. In a lateral-anterior region of MST (MST1), we found both types of pursuit cells; some, like those in MTf, were dependent on visual inputs whereas others, like those in MSTd, received an extraretinal input. 5. We observed a relationship between pursuit responses and passive visual responses. MST cells whose pursuit responses were attributable to extraretinal inputs tended to respond preferentially to large-field random-dot patterns. Some cells that preferred small spots also had an extraretinal input. 6. For 92\% of the pursuit cells we studied, the pursuit response began after onset of the pursuit eye movement. A visual response preceding onset of the eye movement could be observed in many of these cells if the initial motion of the target occurred within the visual receptive field of the cell and in its preferred direction. In contrast to the pursuit response, however, this visual response was not dependent on execution of the pursuit movement. 7. For the remaining 8\% of the pursuit cells, the pursuit discharge began before initiation of the pursuit eye movement. This occurred even though the initial motion of the target was outside the receptive field as mapped during fixation trials. Our data suggest, however, that such responses may be attributable to an expansion of the receptive field that accompanies enhanced visual responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}},

	Abstract = {{This paper introduces a model of oculomotor control during the smooth pursuit of occluded visual targets. This model is based upon active inference, in which subjects try to minimise their (proprioceptive) prediction error based upon posterior beliefs about the hidden causes of their (exteroceptive) sensory input. Our model appeals to a single principle--the minimisation of variational free energy--to provide Bayes optimal solutions to the smooth pursuit problem. However, it tries to accommodate the cardinal features of smooth pursuit of partially occluded targets that have been observed empirically in normal subjects and schizophrenia. Specifically, we account for the ability of normal subjects to anticipate periodic target trajectories and emit pre-emptive smooth pursuit eye movements--prior to the emergence of a target from behind an occluder. Furthermore, we show that a single deficit in the postsynaptic gain of prediction error units (encoding the precision of posterior beliefs) can account for several features of smooth pursuit in schizophrenia: namely, a reduction in motor gain and anticipatory eye movements during visual occlusion, a paradoxical improvement in tracking unpredicted deviations from target trajectories and a failure to recognise and exploit regularities in the periodic motion of visual targets. This model will form the basis of subsequent (dynamic causal) models of empirical eye tracking measurements, which we hope to validate, using psychopharmacology and studies of schizophrenia.}},

@article{Arnold09,
	Abstract = {{When a brief static flash is presented in physical alignment with a moving target, the position of the flash can seem to lag behind that of the moving target. Various explanations exist. One of the most popular is the differential latency hypothesis. This assumes that neural latencies for moving stimuli are shorter than those for static stimuli. Accordingly, the flash lag would occur because perception is temporally fragmented, with moving stimuli seen before static. To test this, observers were asked to make different judgments concerning the same stimulus. Observers either judged if color changes in moving and static stimulus sections were synchronous, or whether the different stimulus sections were aligned at the time of a color change. If the flash-lag were driven by a simple differential latency, we would expect both judgments to be marked by a temporal advantage for moving stimuli. Our results suggest the contrary, as only the later judgment was marked by a flash-lag effect. The apparent timing of moving and static color changes was veridical. However, when we introduced a systematic differential latency, by modulating image contrast, both judgments were affected. Our data therefore suggest that a simple differential can modulate flash-lag type effects, but they do not cause the phenomenon.}},

@article{Kanai04,
	Abstract = {{A moving object is perceived to lie beyond a static object presented at the same time at the same retinal location (flash-lag effect or FLE). Some studies report that if the moving stimulus stops moving (flash-terminated condition or FTC) the instant the flash occurs, a FLE does not occur. Other studies, using different stimuli, report that the FLE does, in fact, occur in the FTC. The FTC is thus a crucial turning point in theories of flash-lag. Unraveling the mystery of the FLE in the FTC will help unravel the mechanisms underpinning flash-lag and perhaps even perceptual localization in general. Our experiments show that eccentricity of the moving stimulus was a contributing factor, as were eccentricity of the flashed stimulus and spatial separation between the two stimuli. Other factors, such as contrast and offset of moving stimulus, also modulate the magnitude of the FLE in the FTC. We surmise that uncertainty in determining the position in space of a moving stimulus is a key requirement for the lag-effect. A lag-effect in the FTC challenges influential models, such as differential latency, motion extrapolation, and postdiction. Based partly on the notion of an asymmetric spread of activity that arises because of the sheer nature of motion and from a combination of established physiological mechanisms, we propose a schematic account of the present findings that subsumes previous psychological models and scaffolds past experimental findings.

	Abstract = {{Recent approaches to estimating two-dimensional image motion and to modeling the perception of image motion have achieved success with Bayesian formulations. With a Bayesian approach, the goal is to compute the posterior probability distribution of velocity, which is proportional to a likelihood function and a prior. The likelihood function describes the probability of observing the image data given the image velocity; surprisingly, there is still disagreement about the right likelihood function to use. Here we derive a likelihood function by starting from a generative model. We assume that the scene translates, conserving image brightness, while the image is equal to the projected scene plus noise. We discuss the connection between the resulting likelihood function and existing models of motion analysis. We show that the likelihood can be calculated by a population of units whose response properties are similar to \motion energy \&amp;quot; units. This suggests that a population of velocity tuned cells in visual cortex may be representing the likelihood function. 1}},

	Abstract = {{Several behavioral experiments suggest that the nervous system uses an internal model of the dynamics of the body to implement a close approximation to a Kalman filter. This filter can be used to perform a variety of tasks nearly optimally, such as predicting the sensory consequence of motor action, integrating sensory and body posture signals, and computing motor commands. We propose that the neural implementation of this Kalman filter involves recurrent basis function networks with attractor dynamics, a kind of architecture that can be readily mapped onto cortical circuits. In such networks, the tuning curves to variables such as arm velocity are remarkably noninvariant in the sense that the amplitude and width of the tuning curves of a given neuron can vary greatly depending on other variables such as the position of the arm or the reliability of the sensory feedback. This property could explain some puzzling properties of tuning curves in the motor and premotor cortex, and it leads to several new predictions.}},

	Abstract = {{The brain makes use of noisy sensory inputs to produce eye, head, or arm motion. In most instances, the brain combines this sensory information with predictions about future events. Here, we propose that Kalman filtering can account for the dynamics of both visually guided and predictive motor behaviors within one simple unifying mechanism. Our model relies on two Kalman filters: (1) one processing visual information about retinal input; and (2) one maintaining a dynamic internal memory of target motion. The outputs of both Kalman filters are then combined in a statistically optimal manner, i.e., weighted with respect to their reliability. The model was tested on data from several smooth pursuit experiments and reproduced all major characteristics of visually guided and predictive smooth pursuit. This contrasts with the common belief that anticipatory pursuit, pursuit maintenance during target blanking, and zero-lag pursuit of sinusoidally moving targets all result from different control systems. This is the first instance of a model integrating all aspects of pursuit dynamics within one coherent and simple model and without switching between different parallel mechanisms. Our model suggests that the brain circuitry generating a pursuit command might be simpler than previously believed and only implement the functional equivalents of two Kalman filters whose outputs are optimally combined. It provides a general framework of how the brain can combine continuous sensory information with a dynamic internal memory and transform it into motor commands.}},

	Abstract = {{Abstract \^{a} In an environment that is temporal as well as spatial in nature, the nervous system of agents needs to deal with various forms of delay, internal or external. Neural (or internal) delay can cause serious problems because by the time the central nervous system receives an input from the periphery, the environmental state is already updated. To be in touch with reality in the present rather than in the past, such a delay has to be compensated. Our observation is that facilitatory dynamics found in synapses can effectively deal with delay by activating in an extrapolatory mode. The idea was tested in a modified 2D pole-balancing problem which included sensory delays. Within this domain, we tested the behavior of recurrent neural networks with facilitatory neural dynamics trained via neuroevolution. Analysis of the performance and the evolved network parameters showed that, under various forms of delay, networks utilizing facilitatory dynamics are at a significant competitive advantage compared to networks with other dynamics.}},

@article{Lim08,
	Abstract = {{Neural conduction delay is a serious issue for organisms that need to act in real time. Various forms of flash-lag effect (FLE) suggest that the nervous system may perform extrapolation to compensate for delay. For example, in motion FLE, the position of a moving object is perceived to be ahead of a brief flash when they are actually colocalized. However, the precise mechanism for extrapolation at a single-neuron level has not been fully investigated. Our hypothesis is that facilitating synapses, with their dynamic sensitivity to the rate of change in the input, can serve as a neural basis for extrapolation. To test this hypothesis, we constructed and tested models of facilitating dynamics. First, we derived a spiking neuron model of facilitating dynamics at a single-neuron level, and tested it in the luminance FLE domain. Second, the spiking neuron model was extended to include multiple neurons and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), and was tested with orientation FLE. The results showed a strong relationship between delay compensation, FLE, and facilitating synapses/STDP. The results are expected to shed new light on real time and predictive processing in the brain, at the single neuron level.}},

	Abstract = {{limits of directional interactions for 105 directionally selective middle temporal (MT) neurons and 26 directionally selective striate (V 1) neurons. Directional interactions were measured using sequentially flashed stimuli in which the spatial and temporal intervals between stimuli were systematically varied over a broad range. A direction index was employed to determine the strength of directional interactions for each combination of spatial and temporal intervals tested. 2. The maximum spatial interval for which directional interactions occurred in a particular neuron was positively correlated with receptive-field size and with retinal eccentricity in both MT and Vl. The maximum spatial interval was, on average, three times as large in MT as in VI. The maximum temporal interval for which we obtained directional interactions was similar in MT and Vl and did not vary with receptive-field size or eccentricity. 3. The maximum spatial interval for directional interactions as measured with flashed stimuli was positively correlated with the maximum speed of smooth motion that yielded directional responses. MT neurons were directionally selective for higher speeds than were Vl neurons. 4. These observations indicate that the large receptive fields found in MT permit direc-tional interactions over longer distances than do the more limited receptive fields of Vl neurons. A functional advantage is thereby conferred on MT neurons because they detect directional differences for higher speeds than do VI neurons. 5. Recent psychophysical studies have measured the spatial and temporal limits for the perception of apparent motion in sequentially flashed visual displays. A comparison of the psychophysical results with our physiological data indicates that the spatiotemporal limits for perception are similar to the limits for direction selectivity in MT neurons but differ markedly from those for VI neurons. These observations suggest a correspondence between neuronal responses in MT and the short-range process of apparent motion.}},

	Abstract = {Omitting a stimulus from a train of repetitive stimuli, by either interrupting or terminating the train, can elicit an electrophysiological response that occurs at the time appropriate for the omitted stimulus. This study investigated whether such an omitted stimulus response ({OSR}) is present in the flicker electroretinogram ({ERG}) of the human cone system. {ERGs} were recorded from 11 visually normal subjects in response to full-field sinusoidal flicker trains presented against a rod-desensitizing adapting field at frequencies ranging from 12.5 to 100 Hz. Recordings were synchronized with the onset of the stimulus trains, and the amplitude and relative delay of any additional {ERG} responses following the offset of the flicker train were analyzed. At stimulus frequencies below 35 Hz, the number of {ERG} responses always equaled the number of stimulus cycles. However, over the frequency range of 38.5 to 100 Hz, the {ERG} contained an extra response following flicker train offset. At stimulus frequencies from 38.5 to 62.5 Hz, there was a constant delay between the peak of the extra {ERG} response and the time at which the next stimulus would have occurred had the flicker train continued. This constant delay is characteristic of an {OSR}. In addition, an extra {ERG} response was apparent at these same stimulus frequencies if the flicker train was interrupted by omitting stimulus cycles from the middle of the train. The pattern of {ERG} findings is consistent with a recently proposed model of the {OSR} that attributes the phenomenon to a resonant oscillation in retinal bipolar cells.},

@article{Watanamiuk94,
	Abstract = {Human observers can easily detect a signal dot moving, in apparent motion, on a trajectory embedded in a background of random-direction motion noise. A high detection rate is possible even though the spatial and temporal characteristics (step size and frame rate) of the signal are identical to the noise, making the signal indistinguishable from the noise on the basis of a single pair of frames. The success rate 3or detecting the signal dot was as high as 90\% when the probability of mismatch from frame-to-frame, based on nearest-neighbor matching, was 0.3. Control experiments showed that trajectory detection is not based on detecting a '' string'' of collinear dots, i.e. a stationary position cue. Nor is a trajectory detected because it produces stronger signals in single independent motion detectors. For one thing, trajectory detection improves with increases in duration, up to 250--400 msec, a duration longer than the integration typically associated with a single motion detector. For another, the signal dot need not travel in a straight line to be detectable. The signal dot was as reliably detected when it changed its direction a small amount (about 30 deg or less) each frame. Consistent with this, circular paths of sufficiently low curvature were as detectable as straight trajectories. Our data suggest that trajectory motion is highly detectable in motion noise because the component local motion signals are enhanced when motion detectors with similar directional tuning are stimulated in a sequence along their preferred direction.},

	Abstract = {1. Recordings were made from single units in the middle temporal visual area ({MT}) of anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. A computer-driven stimulator was used to make quantitative tests of selectivity for stimulus direction, speed, and orientation. The data were taken from 168 units that were histologically identified as being in {MT}. 2. The results confirm previous reports of a high degree of direction selectivity in {MT}. The response above background to stimuli moving in a unit's preferred direction was, an average, 10.9 times that to stimuli moving in the opposite direction. There was a marked tendency for nearby units to have similar preferred directions. 3. Most units were also sharply tuned for the speed of stimulus motion. For some cells the response fell to less than half-maximal at speeds only a factor of two from the optimum; on average, responses were greater than half-maximal only over a 7.7-fold range of speed. The distribution of preferred speeds for different units was unimodal, with a peak near 32 degrees/s; the total range of preferred speeds extended from 2 to 256 degrees/s. Nearby units generally responded best to similar speeds of motion. 4. Most units in {MT} showed selectivity for stimulus orientation when tested with stationary, flashed bars. However, stationary stimuli generally elicited only brief responses; when averaged over the duration of the stimulus, the responses were much less than those to moving stimuli. The preferred orientation was usually, but not always, perpendicular to the preferred direction of movement. 5. A comparison of the results of the present study with a previous quantitative investigation in the owl monkey shows a striking similarity in response properties in {MT} of the two species. 6. The presence of both direction and speed selectivity in {MT} of the macaque suggests that this area is more specialized for the analysis of visual motion than has been previously recognized.},

@article{BennetBarnes2003,
	Abstract = {During the course of pursuing a moving target there are often periods of transient disappearance as it moves behind objects and surfaces. In experimental settings, eye velocity decays rapidly on the extinction of a moving target. However, eye velocity does not decay to zero if there is an expectation the target will reappear further along its trajectory. Increasing eye velocity to coincide with target reappearance could minimize the developing velocity error, but it remains to be empirically verified whether this can be achieved. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of stimulus predictability, target velocity, and interstimulus interval ({ISI}) on ocular pursuit during the transient disappearance of a visual target. We confirmed that subjects (n = 9) did not maintain eye velocity close to target velocity for the duration of the {ISI}. In general, after an initial reduction in eye velocity the majority of subjects (n = 7) exhibited a significant increase before target reappearance. The timing of the velocity increase was not influenced by target velocity, stimulus predictability, or {ISI}. Consequently, for the 900-ms {ISI} the increase occurred too early and the eye was decelerating at the moment of target reappearance. These results are consistent with a reduction in gain being applied to the visuomotor drive when the target disappeared, followed by a reactivation in expectation of target reappearance. We modeled this process such that gain was modulated within a reafferent feedback system, hence preserving its output in the absence of negative visual feedback and enabling an anticipatory increase in eye velocity before expected target reappearance.},

@article{Goldreich92,
	Abstract = {
                1. Our goal was to discriminate between two classes of models for pursuit eye movements. The monkey's pursuit system and both classes of model exhibit oscillations around target velocity during tracking of ramp target motion. However, the mechanisms that determine the frequency of oscillations differ in the two classes of model. In "internal feedback" models, oscillations are controlled by internal feedback loops, and the frequency of oscillation does not depend strongly on the delay in visual feedback. In "image motion" models, oscillations are controlled by visual feedback, and the frequency of oscillation does depend on the delay in visual feedback. 2. We measured the frequency of oscillation during pursuit of ramp target motion as a function of the total delay for visual feedback. For the shortest feedback delays of approximately 70 ms, the frequency of oscillation was between 6 and 7 Hz. Increases in feedback delay caused decreases in the frequency of oscillation. The effect of increasing feedback delay was similar, whether the increases were produced naturally by dimming and decreasing the size of the tracking target or artificially with the computer. We conclude that the oscillations in eye velocity during pursuit of ramp target motion are controlled by visual inputs, as suggested by the image motion class of models. 3. Previous experiments had suggested that the visuomotor pathways for pursuit are unable to respond well to frequencies as high as the 6-7 Hz at which eye velocity oscillates in monkeys. We therefore tested the response to target vibration at an amplitude of +/- 8 degrees/s and frequencies as high as 15 Hz. For target vibration at 6 Hz, the gain of pursuit, defined as the amplitude of eye velocity divided by the amplitude of target velocity, was as high as 0.65. We conclude that the visuomotor pathways for pursuit are capable of processing image motion at high temporal frequencies. 4. The gain of pursuit was much larger when the target vibrated around a constant speed of 15 degrees/s than when it vibrated around a stationary position. This suggests that the pursuit pathways contain a switch that must be closed to allow the visuomotor pathways for pursuit to operate at their full gain. The switch apparently remains open for target vibration around a stationary position. 5. The responses to target vibration revealed a frequency at which eye velocity lagged target velocity by 180 degrees and at which one monkey showed a local peak in the gain of {pursuit.(ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})

	Abstract = {
                We recorded the smooth-pursuit eye movements of monkeys in response to targets that were extinguished (blinked) for 200 ms in mid-trajectory. Eye velocity declined considerably during the target blinks, even when the blinks were completely predictable in time and space. Eye velocity declined whether blinks were presented during steady-state pursuit of a constant-velocity target, during initiation of pursuit before target velocity was reached, or during eye accelerations induced by a change in target velocity. When a physical occluder covered the trajectory of the target during blinks, creating the impression that the target moved behind it, the decline in eye velocity was reduced or abolished. If the target was occluded once the eye had reached target velocity, pursuit was only slightly poorer than normal, uninterrupted pursuit. In contrast, if the target was occluded during the initiation of pursuit, while the eye was accelerating toward target velocity, pursuit during occlusion was very different from normal pursuit. Eye velocity remained relatively stable during target occlusion, showing much less acceleration than normal pursuit and much less of a decline than was produced by a target blink. Anticipatory or predictive eye acceleration was typically observed just prior to the reappearance of the target. Computer simulations show that these results are best understood by assuming that a mechanism of eye-velocity memory remains engaged during target occlusion but is disengaged during target blinks.

	Abstract = {Monkeys and humans are able to perform different types of slow eye movements. The analysis of the eye movement parameters, as well as the investigation of the neuronal activity underlying the execution of slow eye movements, offer an excellent opportunity to study higher brain functions such as motion processing, sensorimotor integration, and predictive mechanisms as well as neuronal plasticity and motor learning. As an example, since there exists a tight connection between the execution of slow eye movements and the processing of any kind of motion, these eye movements can be used as a biological, behavioural probe for the neuronal processing of motion. Global visual motion elicits optokinetic nystagmus, acting as a visual gaze stabilization system. The underlying neuronal substrate consists mainly of the cortico-pretecto-olivo-cerebellar pathway. Additionally, another gaze stabilization system depends on the vestibular input known as the vestibule-ocular reflex. The interactions between the visual and vestibular stabilization system are essential to fulfil the plasticity of the vestibule-ocular reflex representing a simple form of learning. Local visual motion is a necessary prerequisite for the execution of smooth pursuit eye movements which depend on the cortico-pontino-cerebellar pathway. In the wake of saccades, short-latency eye movements can be elicited by brief movements of the visual scene. Finally, eye movements directed to objects in different planes of depth consist of slow movements also. Although there is some overlap in the neuronal substrates underlying these different types of slow eye movements, there are brain areas whose activity can be associated exclusively with the execution of a special type of slow eye movement.

	Abstract = {The function of smooth pursuit is to keep the fovea pointed at a small visual target that moves smoothly across a patterned background. Chemical lesions, single cell recordings, and behavioral measures have shown that the cortical motion processing pathways form the afferent limb for pursuit. Important areas include at least the striate cortex and the middle temporal visual area, and probably the medial superior temporal visual area and the posterior parietal cortex. We argue that the visual inputs are transmitted through a simple sensory motor interface in the pons, to the efferent limb in the brain stem and cerebellum. The efferent limb uses neural velocity memory to maintain pursuit automatically. We present evidence that the velocity memory is provided, at least in part, by eye velocity positive feedback between the flocculus of the cerebellum and the brain stem. Finally, we use a computer model to show how the maintenance of pursuit can be simulated on a millisecond time scale. The structure and internal elements of the model are based on the biological experiments reviewed in our paper. In the past five years, progress on the neural basis of pursuit eye movements has been rapid. Several areas of research have made substantial contributions, by using combinations of new and conventional methods. Many of the pathways that contribute to pursuit have been identified, and their physiological activity and functions are becoming understood. Continuing progress promises to yield an understanding of one specific form of visually guided movement, at the level of neuronal circuits and behavior, in the primate.},

@article{Sotiropoulos11,
	Abstract = {Our perceptions are fundamentally altered by our knowledge of the world. When cloud-gazing, for example, we tend spontaneously to recognize known objects in the random configurations of evaporated moisture. How our brains acquire such knowledge and how it impacts our perceptions is a matter of heated discussion. A topic of recent debate has concerned the hypothesis that our visual system 'assumes' that objects are static or move slowly [1] rather than more quickly [1] , [2] and [3] . This hypothesis, or 'prior on slow speeds', was postulated because it could elegantly explain a number of perceptual biases observed in situations of uncertainty [2]. Interestingly, those biases affect not only the perception of speed, but also the direction of motion. For example, the direction of a line whose endpoints are hidden (as in the 'aperture problem') or poorly visible (for example, at low contrast or for short presentations) is more often perceived as being perpendicular to the line than it really is --- an illusion consistent with expecting that the line moves more slowly than it really does. How this 'prior on slow speeds' is shaped by experience and whether it remains malleable in adults is unclear. Here, we show that systematic exposure to high-speed stimuli can lead to a reversal of this direction illusion. This suggests that the shaping of the brain's prior expectations of even the most basic properties of the environment is a continuous process.},

When the target moved with constant velocity, predictions were extremely accurate, regardless of the spatial and temporal exposure and concealment of the target and regardless of its rate of velocity.

	Abstract = {Exploring visual illusions reveals fundamental principles of cortical processing. Illusory motion perception of non-moving stimuli was described almost a century ago by Gestalt psychologists. However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. To explore cortical mechanisms underlying the 'line-motion' illusion, we used real-time optical imaging, which is highly sensitive to subthreshold activity. We examined, in the visual cortex of the anaesthetized cat, responses to five stimuli: a stationary small square and a long bar; a moving square; a drawn-out bar; and the well-known line-motion illusion, a stationary square briefly preceding a long stationary bar presentation. Whereas flashing the bar alone evoked the expected localized, short latency and high amplitude activity patterns, presenting a square 60-100 ms before a bar induced the dynamic activity patterns resembling that of fast movement. The preceding square, even though physically non-moving, created gradually propagating subthreshold cortical activity that must contribute to illusory motion, because it was indistinguishable from cortical representations of real motion in this area. These findings demonstrate the effect of spatio-temporal patterns of subthreshold synaptic potentials on cortical processing and the shaping of perception.},

	Abstract = {1. Single units in the 3. and 6. nerve nuclei were recorded, together with the stimulus and eye movements in trained macaques during pursuit eye movements. 2. The relationship between the impulse rate of an oculomotor motoneuron and the corresponding eye movements can be described by a first order differential equation only, if distinctions are made between the modes of the oculomotor system (e.g., fixation or pursuit) and between the agonist phase and the antagonist phase of the corresponding eye muscle. 3. The trained monkeys showed a frequency response during pursuit eye movements, which was comparable to that of humans and which clearly indicates the existence of a predictor mechanism. 4. After sudden stimulus disappearance in the pursuit mode, both the neural impulse rate and the eye movement performed smooth changes for more than 1s. These slow post-pursuit eye movements were related to the time course before stimulus disappearance. 5. Our findings lead to the hypothesis, that pursuit eye movements in primates, if elicited by small moving visual stimuli, are generated by means of a feedback system consisting of a predictor mechanism, the parameters of which are continuously corrected by an updating process in the afferent visual system.},

@article{Becker1985Prediction,
	Abstract = {Eye movements were recorded in human subjects who tracked a target spot which moved horizontally at constant speeds. At random times during its trajectory, the target disappeared for variable periods of time and the subjects attempted to continue tracking the invisible target. The smooth pursuit component of their eye movements was isolated and averaged. About 190 ms after the target disappeared, the smooth pursuit velocity began to decelerate rapidly. The time course of this deceleration was similar to that in response to a visible target whose velocity decreased suddenly. After a deceleration lasting about 280 ms, the velocity stabilized at a new, reduced level which we call the residual velocity. The residual velocity remained more or less constant or declined only slowly even when the target remained invisible for 4 s. When the same target velocity was used in all trials of an experiment, the subjects' residual velocity amounted to 60\% of their normal pursuit velocity. When the velocity was varied randomly from trial to trial, the residual velocity was smaller; for target velocities of 5, 10, and 20 deg/s it reached 55, 47, and 39\% respectively. The subjects needed to see targets of unforeseeable velocity for no more than 300 ms in order to develop a residual velocity that was characteristic of the given target velocity. When a target of unknown velocity disappeared at the very moment the subject expected it to start, a smooth movement developed nonetheless and reached within 300 ms a peak velocity of 5 deg/s which was independent of the actual target velocity and reflected a "default" value for the pursuit system. Thereafter the eyes decelerated briefly and then continued with a constant or slightly decreasing velocity of 2-4 deg/s until the target reappeared. Even when the subjects saw no moving target during an experiment, they could produce a smooth movement in the dark and could grade its velocity as a function of that of an imagined target. We suggest that the residual velocity reflects a first order prediction of target movement which is attenuated by a variable gain element. When subjects are pursuing a visible target, the gain of this element is close to unity. When the target disappears but continued tracking is attempted, the gain is reduced to a value between 0.4 and 0.6.},

@article{Pavel92,
	Abstract = {We investigated observers' ability to extrapolate a linear trajectory of a moving point, in order to determine how effectively the visual system can combine orientation and position information for moving stimuli. Observers saw a probe dot moving along a straight line toward a stationary target dot. The probe dot extinguished before reaching the target, and the observers' task was to judge whether an extrapolation of the trajectory of the probe would pass to the left or right of the target. Performance was measured as a function of probe velocity, length of the visible trajectory, and location of the target. The empirical results indicated that over a range of conditions, performance on this task is qualitatively similar to, but somewhat less accurate than, that on an analogous task with static stimuli. A four-component model is presented to account for the results. The model specifies an accurate extraction of probe motion parameters, extrapolation of the motion by an ideal observer, and limitations on the input to these processes in the form of visual field spatial inhomogeneity and temporal decay of position information.},

@article{Sokolov1997Motion,
	Abstract = {A study of the effect of the size of a moving target and the extent of its visible motion on motion extrapolation is reported. Targets (a horizontal pair of dots separated by either 0.2 or 0.8 deg) moved across a 10 deg rectilinear path and were then occluded. Observers pressed a key when they thought the leading dot of a hidden target had reached a randomly specified position (0-12 deg from the point of occlusion). In experiment 1, in agreement with velocity-transposition predictions, at moderate (5 deg s-1) and rapid (10 deg s-1) velocities extrapolation times were longer for large targets than for small ones. At slow velocity (2.5 deg s-1) this effect was reversed. In experiment 2 the effect of target size at moderate velocity was found for a short (2.5 deg) visible path. However, the extrapolation time increased with shorter (2.5 deg versus 10 deg) paths. A proposed account of these effects suggests that the visual system performs a spatiotemporal scaling, according to the velocity-transposition principle, not only of visible motion but also of extrapolated motion.},

@article{Barnes1991Mechanism,
	Abstract = {1. Experiments have been conducted on human subjects to determine the role of prediction in smooth eye movement control. Subjects were required to actively pursue a small target or stare passively at a larger display as it moved in the horizontal plane. 2. Target motion was basically periodic, but, after a random number of cycles an unexpected change was made in the amplitude, direction or frequency of target motion. Initially, the periodic stimulus took the form of a square waveform. In subsequent experiments, a triangular or sawtooth waveform was used, but in order to examine the timing of the response in relation to stimulus appearance, the target was tachistoscopically illuminated for 40-320 ms at the time that it passed through the mid-line position. 3. When subjects either actively pursued the target or stared passively at the larger display a characteristic pattern of steady-state eye movement was evoked composed of two phases, an initial build-up of eye velocity that reached a peak after 200 ms, followed by a decay phase with a time constant of 0.5-2 s. The build-up phase was initiated prior to target displacement for square-wave motion and before onset of target illumination for other waveforms. 4. The peak eye velocity evoked gradually increased over the first two to four cycles of repeated stimulation. Simultaneously, the response became more phase advanced, the reaction time between stimulus onset and the time at which peak velocity occurred decreasing from an average of 300 to 200 ms for triangular waveform stimuli. 5. When there was a sudden and unexpected change in amplitude and direction of the stimulus waveform, the eye movement induced had a peak velocity and direction that was inappropriate for the current visual stimulus, but which was highly correlated with the features of the preceding sequence in the stimulus. 6. When there was a sudden change in the frequency of the stimulus waveform the predictive eye movement was induced with a timing appropriate to the periodicity of the previous sequence but inappropriate to the new sequence. 7. The results indicate that prediction is carried out through the storage of information about both the magnitude and timing of eye velocity. The trajectory of the averaged eye velocity response was similar in form irrespective of the duration of target exposure or basic stimulus frequency, suggesting that the predictive estimate is released as a stereotyped volley of constant duration but varying magnitude under the control of a periodicity {estimator.(ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

@article{Reynaud12,
	Abstract = {To efficiently drive many behaviors, sensory systems have to integrate the activity of large neuronal populations within a limited time window. These populations need to rapidly achieve a robust representation of the input image, probably through canonical computations such as divisive normalization. However, little is known about the dynamics of the corticocortical interactions implementing these rapid and robust computations. Here, we measured the real-time activity of a large neuronal population in V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging in behaving monkeys. We found that contrast gain of the population increases over time with a time constant of ∼30 ms and propagates laterally over the cortical surface. This dynamic is well accounted for by a divisive normalization achieved through a recurrent network that transiently increases in size after response onset with a slow swelling speed of 0.007--0.014 m/s, suggesting a polysynaptic intracortical origin. In the presence of a surround, this normalization pool is gradually balanced by lateral inputs propagating from distant cortical locations. This results in a centripetal propagation of surround suppression at a speed of 0.1--0.3 m/s, congruent with horizontal intracortical axons speed. We propose that a simple generalized normalization scheme can account for both the dynamical contrast response function through recurrent polysynaptic intracortical loops and for the surround suppression through long-range monosynaptic horizontal spread. Our results demonstrate that V1 achieves a rapid and robust context-dependent input normalization through a timely push--pull between local and lateral networks. We suggest that divisive normalization, a fundamental canonical computation, should be considered as a dynamic process.},

@article{Wuerger10,
	Abstract = {Many tasks involve the precise estimation of speed and position of moving objects, for instance to catch or avoid objects that cohabit in our environment. Many of these objects are characterised by signal representations in more than one modality, such as hearing and vision. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which the simultaneous presentation of auditory and visual signals enhances the estimation of motion speed and instantaneous position. Observers are asked to estimate the instant when a moving object arrives at a target spatial position by pressing a response button. This task requires observers to estimate the speed of the moving object and to calibrate the timing of their manual response such that it coincides with the true arrival time of the moving object. When both visual and auditory motion signals are available, the variability in estimating the arrival time of the moving object is significantly reduced compared to the variability in the unimodal conditions. This reduction in variability is consistent with optimal integration of the auditory and visual speed signals. The average bias in the estimated arrival times depends on the motion speed: for medium speeds (17 deg/s) observers' subjective arrival times are earlier than the true arrival times; for high speeds (47 deg/s) observers exhibit a (much smaller) bias in the other direction. This speed-dependency suggests that the bias is due to an error in estimating the motion speeds rather than an error in calibrating the timing of the motor response. Finally, in this temporal localization task, the bias and variability show similar patterns for motion defined by vision, audition or both.},

@article{Graf2003,
	Abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The human visual system often encounters situations in which moving objects disappear behind an occluding surface. In such situations it might be beneficial to predict where the object will emerge on the other side of the occluder. Here we investigate the information in the scene, and in the motion of the object, that is important to observers when performing such a task. {METHODS}: Observers were asked to track a small dot on the screen as it moved towards a vertical occluder, which was clearly visible. The point initially moved purely horizontally. At subsequent time steps the speed was held constant while the direction of the velocity was sampled from a unimodal probability distribution which was symmetric about the current direction. As soon as the dot reached the occluder it disappeared. Observers were asked to estimate where the dot would emerge on the other side of the occluder, as well as indicate a vertical interval around that point that they were certain would capture the dot as it emerged. Between trials the variance of the direction distribution was changed, increasing or decreasing the 'randomness' of the path. Occluder width and dot speed were also manipulated between trials. {RESULTS}: We found that observers increased the size of the capture region as the variance of the direction distribution increased. The capture region also increased in size with increasing occluder width, however, we found no effect of speed. {CONCLUSIONS}: Human observers extrapolate motion by integrating what is known about the characteristics of the path with information about the scene. We discuss and model this data in terms of a probabilistic account of motion perception.},

A new picture emerges from these findings that helps resolve a vexing paradox between the retina's structure and function.

	Abstract = {Binocular competition is thought to drive eye-specific segregation in the developing visual system, potentially through Hebbian synaptic learning rules that are sensitive to correlations in afferent activity. Altering retinal activity can disrupt eye-specific segregation, but little is known about the temporal features of binocular activity that modulate visual map development. We used optogenetic techniques to directly manipulate retinal activity in vivo and identified a critical period before eye opening in mice when specific binocular features of retinal activity drive visual map development. Synchronous activation of both eyes disrupted segregation, whereas asynchronous stimulation enhanced segregation. The optogenetic stimulus applied was spatially homogenous; accordingly, retinotopy of ipsilateral projections was markedly perturbed, but contralateral retinotopy was unaffected or even improved. These results provide direct evidence that the synchrony and precise temporal pattern of binocular retinal activity during a critical period in development regulates eye-specific segregation and retinotopy in the developing visual system.},

	Abstract = {A recent challenge to the completeness of some influential models of local-motion detection has come from experiments in which subjects had to detect a single dot moving along a trajectory amidst noise dots undergoing Brownian motion. We propose and test a new theory of the detection and measurement of visual motion, which can account for these {signal-in-Brownian}-noise experiments. The theory postulates that the signals from local-motion detectors are made coherent in space and time by a special purpose network, and that this coherence boosts signals of features moving along non-random trajectories over time. Two experiments were performed to estimate parameters and test the theory. These experiments showed that detection is impaired with increasing eccentricity, an effect that varies inversely with step size. They also showed that detection improves over durations extending to at least 600 msec. An implementation of the theory accounts for these psychophysical detection measurements.},

	Abstract = {Four dots in an imaginary diamond were flashed in succession to give ambiguous apparent motion ({AM}). The top and bottom dots were flashed at time t1 and replaced by the left and right dots at time t2. If two priming dots were flashed beforehand at time t0 in line with two parallel sides of the diamond, {AM} was seen along those sides. We call this '' visual inertia''. The amount of visual inertia (measured by a null method) fell off with increasing angle between the priming dot and the side of the diamond. Visual inertia was still seen when the priming dots were presented to one eye and the test dots to the other, so the effect must be partly central. The timing and length of the priming path made little difference to visual inertia. However, static priming dots were ineffective. We conclude that the visual system was examining at least three successive time frames in deciding which items in one frame correspond with which items in succeeding frames.},

	Abstract = {An object moving in discrete steps can appear to move continuously even along sections of the path in which no stimulus is presented. We investigated whether the internal representation of such an object is constructed by extrapolation, along the expected trajectory of the object, or by interpolation, after the subsequent reappearance of the object. Observers viewed two discs moving in an unambiguous apparent motion display, which either occasionally reversed direction or continued moving along the predicted path. Observers carried out a speeded {2AFC} task on probes presented between the possible disc locations. In the continuous condition, observers' reaction times to detect and identify a probe were longer when it occurred ahead of the disc than when it occurred elsewhere on the motion path. Conversely, when the disc reversed direction, significantly less interference was observed ahead of the disc (along the predicted motion path), and significantly more interference was observed behind the disc (along the updated motion path). We conclude that the representation of a moving object in an apparent motion display is constructed by interpolation as well as extrapolation. We demonstrate that this representation is maintained and updated even outside the locus of focused attention, and that it is possible to dissociate the contributions of interpolation and extrapolation mechanisms to an object's representation.},

@article{Makin09,
	Abstract = {Previous research suggests that there is overlap between the systems used for tracking visible and occluded moving targets. Both visually derived and stored velocity information provide input to the tracking system when the target is visible, but after occlusion the system receives its input solely from stored velocity representations. We used {EEG} to investigate the transition to purely memory guided tracking after the initial period of occlusion. Participants fixated while they covertly tracked targets moving horizontally rightward at velocities of 12 or 20 degrees. The targets were either continuously visible or disappeared for a short interval mid trajectory. Similar positive event related components were recorded over the right occipitoparietal region in both tasks, providing further evidence that the same neural systems are involved in tracking both visible and occluded targets. Furthermore, when the target was visible, the development of this positivity was linked to the spatial location of the target, peaking earlier in the 20 degrees condition. However, in the occluded condition the positive deflection began around 200 ms following the onset of occlusion and was not modulated by target velocity or location. This indicates a neural response after occlusion is cortically registered, consistent with the hypothesis that there is increased reliance on memory guided tracking at this point.},

	Abstract = {Transmission delay of neural signals would introduce a spatial lag when an object moves across the visual field if it was not compensated. A visual predictive mechanism has been proposed to overcome such neural delay by extrapolating the position of the moving object. However, a forward shift is often absent at motion termination. A recent ??correction-for-extrapolation?? hypothesis suggests that the absence of forward shifts arises from biased competition process due to signals representing failed predictions. To test this hypothesis, we examined the perceived shifts of the final and the initial position of a dim moving object in the rod-free central fovea. The forward shifts were observed in both conditions. In the second experiment, we compared the perceived position shifts of a blue moving object and a green moving object. Given that the foveola is covered in a yellow macular pigment and absorbs blue light, the position signal of a blue object is weak or even absent. The forward shift at motion offset was only found with the blue moving object. The results provide new evidence for the ??correction-for-extrapolation?? hypothesis.},

Here we address the question whether changes in stimulus contrast also affect smooth pursuit eye movements. Subjects were asked to smoothly track a moving Gabor patch. Targets varied in velocity (1, 8, and 15 deg/s), spatial frequency (0.1, 1, 4, and 8 c/deg), and contrast, ranging from just below individual thresholds to maximum contrast. Results show that smooth pursuit eye velocity gain rose significantly with increasing contrast. Below a contrast level of two to three times threshold, pursuit gain, acceleration, latency, and positional accuracy were severely impaired. Therefore, the smooth pursuit motor response shows the same kind of slowing at low contrast that was demonstrated in previous studies on perception.},

	Abstract = {In 1960, {R.E}. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},

	Abstract = {Human visual speed perception is qualitatively consistent with a Bayesian observer that optimally combines noisy measurements with a prior preference for lower speeds. Quantitative validation of this model, however, is difficult because the precise noise characteristics and prior expectations are unknown. Here, we present an augmented observer model that accounts for the variability of subjective responses in a speed discrimination task. This allowed us to infer the shape of the prior probability as well as the internal noise characteristics directly from psychophysical data. For all subjects, we found that the fitted model provides an accurate description of the data across a wide range of stimulus parameters. The inferred prior distribution shows significantly heavier tails than a Gaussian, and the amplitude of the internal noise is approximately proportional to stimulus speed and depends inversely on stimulus contrast. The framework is general and should prove applicable to other experiments and perceptual modalities.},

@article{Madelain03,
	Abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated learning in the pursuit system, but it is unclear whether these effects are the result of changes in visual or motor processing. The ability to maintain smooth pursuit during the transient disappearance of a visual target provides a way to assess pursuit properties in the absence of visual inputs. To study the long-term effects of learning on nonvisual signals for pursuit, we used an operant conditioning procedure. By providing a reinforcing auditory stimulus during periods of accurate tracking, we increased the pursuit velocity gain during target blanking from 0.59 in the baseline session to 0.89 after 8 to 10 daily sessions of training. Learning also reduced the occurrence of saccades. The learned effects generalized to untrained target velocities and persisted in the presence of a textured visual background. In a yoked-control group, the reinforcer was independent of the subjects' responses, and the velocity gain remained unchanged (from 0.6 to 0.63, respectively, before and after training). In a control group that received no reinforcer, gain increased slightly after repetition of the task (from 0.63 to 0.71, respectively, before and after training). Using a model of pursuit, we show that these effects of learning can be simulated by modifying the gain of an extra-retinal signal. Our results demonstrate that learned contingencies can increase eye velocity in the absence of visual signals and support the view that pursuit is regulated by extra-retinal signals that can undergo long-term plasticity.},

@article{Perrinet12pred,
	Abstract = {In low-level sensory systems, it is still unclear how the noisy information collected locally by neurons may give rise to a coherent global percept. This is well demonstrated for the detection of motion in the aperture problem: as luminance of an elongated line is symmetrical along its axis, tangential velocity is ambiguous when measured locally. Here, we develop the hypothesis that motion-based predictive coding is sufficient to infer global motion. Our implementation is based on a context-dependent diffusion of a probabilistic representation of motion. We observe in simulations a progressive solution to the aperture problem similar to physio-logy and behavior. We demonstrate that this solution is the result of two underlying mechanisms. First, we demonstrate the formation of a tracking behavior favoring temporally coherent features independent of their texture. Second, we observe that incoherent features are explained away, while coherent information diffuses progressively to the global scale. Most previous models included ad hoc mechanisms such as end-stopped cells or a selection layer to track specific luminance-based features as necessary conditions to solve the aperture problem. Here, we have proved that motion-based predictive coding, as it is implemented in this functional model, is sufficient to solve the aperture problem. This solution may give insights into the role of prediction underlying a large class of sensory computations.},

	Abstract = {
                Pattern recognition is one of the most important tasks of the visual system, and uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying recognition phenomena has been a focus of researchers for decades. Surprisingly, at the earliest stages of vision, the retina is capable of highly sophisticated temporal pattern recognition. We stimulated the retina of tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) with periodic dark flash sequences and found that retinal ganglion cells had a wide variety of different responses to a periodic flash sequence with many firing when a flash was omitted. The timing of the omitted stimulus response ({OSR}) depended on the period, with individual cells tracking the stimulus period down to increments of 5 ms. When flashes occurred earlier than expected, cells updated their expectation of the next flash time by as much as 50 ms. When flashes occurred later than expected, cells fired an {OSR} and reset their temporal expectation to the average time interval between flashes. Using pharmacology to investigate the retinal circuitry involved, we found that inhibitory transmission from amacrine cells was not required, but on bipolar cells were required. The results suggest a mechanism in which the intrinsic resonance of on bipolars leads to the {OSR} in ganglion cells. We discuss the implications of retinal pattern recognition on the neural code of the retina and visual processing in general.

@article{Arnold07,
	Abstract = {Motion contained within a static object can cause illusory position shifts toward the direction of internal motion. Here we present data suggesting this illusion is driven by modulations of apparent contrast. We observe position shifts at blurred stimulus regions without corresponding changes to internal structure, and find that low-contrast targets are more difficult to detect at the trailing, as opposed to leading, edges of movement. Motion induced position shifts are also shown to occur without conscious appreciation of motion direction. Our data suggests that motion can influence spatial coding via interactions that modulate apparent contrast, thereby changing the regions of the stimulus that are visible.},

@article{Assad95,
	Abstract = {For many types of behaviours, it is necessary to monitor the position or movement of objects that are temporarily occluded. The primate posterior parietal cortex contains neurons that are active during visual guidance tasks: in some cases, even if the visual target disappears transiently. It has been proposed that activity of this sort could be related to current or planned eye movements, but it might also provide a more generalized abstract representation of the spatial disposition of targets, even when they are not visible. We have recorded from monkey posterior parietal cortex while the animal viewed a visual stimulus that disappeared, and then, depending on experimental context, could be inferred to be either moving or stationary. During this temporary absence of the stimulus, about half of the neurons were found to be significantly more active on those trials in which the stimulus could be presumed to be moving rather than stationary. The activity was thus present in the absence of either sensory input or motor output, suggesting that it may indeed constitute a generalized representation of target motion.},

	Abstract = {The local spatiotemporal pattern of light on the retina is often consistent with a single translational velocity which may also be interpreted as a superposition of spatial patterns translating with different velocities. Human perception reflects such interpretations, as can be demonstrated using stimuli constructed from a superposition of two drifting gratings. Depending on a variety of parameters, these stimuli may be perceived as a coherently moving plaid pattern or as two transparent gratings moving in different directions. Here, we propose a quantitative model that explains how and why such interpretations are selected. An observer's percept corresponds to the most probable interpretation of noisy measurements of local image motion, based on separate prior beliefs about the speed and singularity of visual motion. This model accounts for human perceptual interpretations across a broad range of angles and speeds. With optimized parameters, its components are consistent with previous results in motion perception.},

	Comment = {* "Processing delay in the neural pathway on the order of tens of milliseconds should cause a significant offset between the perceived and the actual positions of a moving object. An appealing hypothesis is that the visual system can compensate for the neural delay and reduce the perceptual misalignment by extrapolating the trajectory of the moving object (Nijhawan, 1994, 1997). Evidence for motion extrapolation originally came from the flash-lag illusion in which the position of a moving object is perceived to be ahead of a briefly flashed object when they are physically colocalized at the time of the flash (MacKay, 1958; Nijhawan, 1994, 1997)." * "A neuronal model for the perceptual extrapolation What is the mechanism underlying the blur-dependent perceptual extrapolation? In a visuotopically organized neuronal circuit, the spatial profile of the population neural response moves within the circuit when the target moves in the visual field, and the position of the response profile may determine the perceived position of the visual target. In the rabbit and salamander retina, the transient response property and the contrast-gain control mechanism have been shown to shift the response profile of the retinal ganglion cells in the direction of target motion, which has been proposed as a mechanism for motion extrapolation (Berry et al., 1999). To test whether these retinal response properties can account for the blur-dependent perceptual extrapolation observed in this study, we simulated the response of each neuron to the motion-stop stimuli using these response properties and predicted the spatial profile of the population response of an array of neurons (see Materials and Methods). Surprisingly, we found that a simple model incorporating only the biphasic temporal response property (Fig. 3A) is sufficient to account for the spatiotemporal characteristics of the observed perceptual extrapolation." * a simple second-order motion: "The contrast-defined stimulus was a stationary sinusoidal grating at a high spatial frequency, with its contrast modulated by a moving Gaussian envelope (Fig. 4A)."},

@article{Makin11,
	Abstract = {People are able to judge the current position of occluded moving objects. This operation is known as motion extrapolation. It has previously been suggested that motion extrapolation is independent of the oculomotor system. Here we revisited this question by measuring eye position while participants completed two types of motion extrapolation task. In one task, a moving visual target travelled rightwards, disappeared, then reappeared further along its trajectory. Participants discriminated correct reappearance times from incorrect (too early or too late) with a two-alternative forced-choice button press. In the second task, the target travelled rightwards behind a visible, rectangular occluder, and participants pressed a button at the time when they judged it should reappear. In both tasks, performance was significantly different under fixation as compared to free eye movement conditions. When eye movements were permitted, eye movements during occlusion were related to participants' judgements. Finally, even when participants were required to fixate, small changes in eye position around fixation (<2\$\\,^{\\circ}\$) were influenced by occluded target motion. These results all indicate that overlapping systems control eye movements and judgements on motion extrapolation tasks. This has implications for understanding the mechanism underlying motion extrapolation.},

	Abstract = {A critical step in the interpretation of the visual world is the integration of the various local motion signals generated by moving objects. This process is complicated by the fact that local velocity measurements can differ depending on contour orientation and spatial position. Specifically, any local motion detector can measure only the component of motion perpendicular to a contour that extends beyond its field of view1, 2. This "aperture problem"3 is particularly relevant to direction-selective neurons early in the visual pathways, where small receptive fields permit only a limited view of a moving object. Here we show that neurons in the middle temporal visual area (known as {MT} or V5) of the macaque brain reveal a dynamic solution to the aperture problem. {MT} neurons initially respond primarily to the component of motion perpendicular to a contour's orientation, but over a period of approximately 60 ms the responses gradually shift to encode the true stimulus direction, regardless of orientation. We also report a behavioural correlate of these neural responses: the initial velocity of pursuit eye movements deviates in a direction perpendicular to local contour orientation, suggesting that the earliest neural responses influence the oculomotor response.},

@incollection{MassonMontagnini10,
	Abstract = {To accurately track a moving object of interest with appropriate smooth eye movements, the brain needs to reconstruct a single velocity vector describing the global motion of this object. Because of the aperture problem (see Chap. 1), the visual system must integrate piecewise local information from either elongated edges and contours or particular features such as corners and texture elements. Here, we show that investigating smooth eye movements unveil several dynamical properties of this visual motion integration stage. Signals are weighted according to their uncertainties. The integration is highly dynamical - eye movements being always launched first in the simplest, linear (vector sum) prediction. Tracking trajectories are then progressively adjusted to match the object trajectory after 200 ms of pursuit. Such strategy is immune to higher factors such as prediction about incoming {2D} target trajectory. On the contrary, mixing retinal and extra-retinal signals become important later during the pursuit to accommodate partial or total object motion occlusion for instance. We propose a framework computing and representing object motion through two recurrent loops ({V1-MT} and {MST}-{FEF}, respectively), with area {MST} playing the role of gear. Such architecture would accommodate two important constraints of motor behavior: quick reaction to a new visual event and utilization of extra-retinal information to smooth out transient changes in the image such as those occurring when an object moves in a crowded environment.},

	Abstract = {When a flash is aligned with a moving object, subjects perceive the flash to lag behind the moving object. Two different models have been proposed to explain this ?flash-lag? effect. In the motion extrapolation model, the visual system extrapolates the location of the moving object to counteract neural propagation delays, whereas in the latency difference model, it is hypothesized that moving objects are processed and perceived more quickly than flashed objects. However, recent psychophysical experiments suggest that neither of these interpretations is feasible (Eagleman \& Sejnowski, 2000a, 2000b, 2000c), hypothesizing instead that the visual system uses data from the future of an event before committing to an interpretation. We formalize this idea in terms of the statistical framework of optimal smoothing and show that a model based on smoothing accounts for the shape of psychometric curves from a flash-lag experiment involving random reversals of motion direction. The smoothing model demonstrates how the visual system may enhance perceptual accuracy by relying not only on data from the past but also on data collected from the immediate future of an event.

@article{Burgi00,
	Abstract = {We develop a theory for the temporal integration of visual motion motivated by psychophysical experiments. The theory proposes that input data are temporally grouped and used to predict and estimate the motion flows in the image sequence. This temporal grouping can be considered a generalization of the data association techniques that engineers use to study motion sequences. Our temporal grouping theory is expressed in terms of the Bayesian generalization of standard Kalman filtering. To implement the theory, we derive a parallel network that shares some properties of cortical networks. Computer simulations of this network demonstrate that our theory qualitatively accounts for psychophysical experiments on motion occlusion and motion outliers. In deriving our theory, we assumed spatial factorizability of the probability distributions and made the approximation of updating the marginal distributions of velocity at each point. This allowed us to perform local computations and simplified our implementation. We argue that these approximations are suitable for the stimuli we are considering (for which spatial coherence effects are negligible).},

	Abstract = {Neurons in area {MT} (V5) are selective for the direction of visual motion. In addition, many are selective for the motion of complex patterns independent of the orientation of their components, a behavior not seen in earlier visual areas. We show that the responses of {MT} cells can be captured by a linear-nonlinear model that operates not on the visual stimulus, but on the afferent responses of a population of nonlinear V1 cells. We fit this cascade model to responses of individual {MT} neurons and show that it robustly predicts the separately measured responses to gratings and plaids. The model captures the full range of pattern motion selectivity found in {MT}. Cells that signal pattern motion are distinguished by having convergent excitatory input from V1 cells with a wide range of preferred directions, strong motion opponent suppression and a tuned normalization that may reflect suppressive input from the surround of V1 cells.},

@article{Montagnini07,
	Abstract = {The quality of the representation of an object's motion is limited by the noise in the sensory input as well as by an intrinsic ambiguity due to the spatial limi- tation of the visual motion analyzers (aperture prob- lem). Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that motion processing of extended ob jects is initially dominated by the local {1D} motion cues orthogonal to the ob ject's edges, whereas {2D} information takes pro- gressively over and leads to the final correct represen- tation of global motion. A Bayesian framework ac- counting for the sensory noise and general expectancies for ob ject velocities has proven successful in explaining several experimental findings concerning early motion processing [1, 2, 3]. However, a complete functional model, encompassing the dynamical evolution of ob- ject motion perception is still lacking. Here we outline several experimental observations concerning human smooth pursuit of moving ob jects and more particu- larly the time course of its initiation phase. In addi- tion, we propose a recursive extension of the Bayesian model, motivated and constrained by our oculomotor data, to describe the dynamical integration of {1D} and {2D} motion information.},

@article{Perrinet07,
	Abstract = {The machinery behind the visual perception of motion and the subsequent sensori-motor transformation, such as in ocular following response ({OFR}), is confronted to uncertainties which are efficiently resolved in the primate's visual system. We may understand this response as an ideal observer in a probabilistic framework by using Bayesian theory [Weiss, Y., Simoncelli, {E.P}., Adelson, {E.H}., 2002. Motion illusions as optimal percepts. Nature Neuroscience, 5(6), 598-604, doi:10.1038/nn858] which we previously proved to be successfully adapted to model the {OFR} for different levels of noise with full field gratings. More recent experiments of {OFR} have used disk gratings and bipartite stimuli which are optimized to study the dynamics of center-surround integration. We quantified two main characteristics of the spatial integration of motion: (i) a finite optimal stimulus size for driving {OFR}, surrounded by an antagonistic modulation and (ii) a direction selective suppressive effect of the surround on the contrast gain control of the central stimuli [Barth\'{e}lemy, {F.V}., Vanzetta, I., Masson, {G.S}., 2006. Behavioral receptive field for ocular following in humans: dynamics of spatial summation and center-surround interactions. Journal of Neurophysiology, (95), 3712-3726, doi:10.1152/jn.00112.2006]. Herein, we extended the ideal observer model to simulate the spatial integration of the different local motion cues within a probabilistic representation. We present analytical results which show that the hypothesis of independence of local measures can describe the spatial integration of the motion signal. Within this framework, we successfully accounted for the contrast gain control mechanisms observed in the behavioral data for center-surround stimuli. However, another inhibitory mechanism had to be added to account for suppressive effects of the surround.},

@article{Barthelemy08a,
	Abstract = {Integrating information is essential to measure the physical {2D} motion of a surface from both ambiguous local {1D} motion of its elongated edges and non-ambiguous {2D} motion of its features such as corners or texture elements. The dynamics of this motion integration shows a complex time course as read from tracking eye movements: first, local {1D} motion signals are extracted and pooled to initiate ocular responses, then {2D} motion signals are integrated to adjust the tracking direction until it matches the surface motion direction. The nature of these {1D} and {2D} motion computations are still unclear. One hypothesis is that their different dynamics may be explained from different contrast sensitivities. To test this, we measured contrast-response functions of early, {1D}-driven and late, {2D}-driven components of ocular following responses to different motion stimuli: gratings, plaids and barberpoles. We found that contrast dynamics of {1D}-driven responses are nearly identical across the different stimuli. On the contrary, late {2D}-driven components with either plaids or barberpoles have similar latencies but different contrast dynamics. Temporal dynamics of both {1D}- and {2D}-driven responses demonstrates that the different contrast gains are set very early during the response time course. Running a Bayesian model of motion integration, we show that a large family of contrast-response functions can be predicted from the probability distributions of {1D} and {2D} motion signals for each stimulus and by the shape of the prior distribution. However, the pure delay (i.e. largely independent upon contrast) observed between {1D}- and {2D}-motion supports the fact that {1D} and {2D} probability distributions are computed independently. This two-pathway Bayesian model supports the idea that {1D} and {2D} mechanisms represent edges and features motion in parallel.},

@article{Bogadhi11,
	Abstract = {Accuracy in estimating an object's global motion over time is not only affected by the noise in visual motion information but also by the spatial limitation of the local motion analyzers (aperture problem). Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that during the initial stages of the motion information processing, {1D} motion cues related to the object's edges have a dominating influence over the estimate of the object's global motion. However, during the later stages, {2D} motion cues related to terminators (edge-endings) progressively take over, leading to a final correct estimate of the object's global motion. Here, we propose a recursive extension to the Bayesian framework for motion processing (Weiss, Simoncelli, \& Adelson, 2002) cascaded with a model oculomotor plant to describe the dynamic integration of {1D} and {2D} motion information in the context of smooth pursuit eye movements. In the recurrent Bayesian framework, the prior defined in the velocity space is combined with the two independent measurement likelihood functions, representing edge-related and terminator-related information, respectively to obtain the posterior. The prior is updated with the posterior at the end of each iteration step. The maximum-a posteriori ({MAP}) of the posterior distribution at every time step is fed into the oculomotor plant to produce eye velocity responses that are compared to the human smooth pursuit data. The recurrent model was tuned with the variance of pursuit responses to either "pure" {1D} or "pure" {2D} motion. The oculomotor plant was tuned with an independent set of oculomotor data, including the effects of line length (i.e. stimulus energy) and directional anisotropies in the smooth pursuit responses. The model not only provides an accurate qualitative account of dynamic motion integration but also a quantitative account that is close to the smooth pursuit response across several conditions (three contrasts and three speeds) for two human subjects.},

	Abstract = {In a recent Bayesian model by Weiss, Simoncelli, and Adelson, motion perception is biased by a prior favoring slow speeds. This model predicts qualitatively an impressive variety of phenomena, including the dependence of perceived speed on contrast. We show that the model can also generate quantitative predictions: for a drifting grating with contrast c, perceived speed is proportional to c(q)/(k(q) + c(q)), with k, q constants. We tested this expression on measurements of perceived speed as a function of contrast. Observers indicated the slower of two drifting gratings, a test and a standard. For each test contrast we found the test speed that appeared to match the standard speed. The model fits the data, but only if q is less than 2, the value it would have if the internal representation of contrast were linear. The Bayesian model can make correct quantitative predictions, but needs to be extended to incorporate a more realistic, nonlinear representation of contrast.},

	Abstract = {Short-latency ocular following are reflexive, tracking eye movements that are observed in human and non-human primates in response to a sudden and brief translation of the image. Initial, open-loop part of the eye acceleration reflects many of the properties attributed to low-level motion processing. We review a very large set of behavioral data demonstrating several key properties of motion detection and integration stages and their dynamics. We propose that these properties can be modeled as a behavioral receptive field exhibiting linear and nonlinear mechanisms responsible for context-dependent spatial integration and gain control. Functional models similar to that used for describing neuronal properties of receptive fields can then be applied successfully.},

@article{Perrinet10shl,
	Abstract = {Neurons in the input layer of primary visual cortex in primates develop edge-like receptive fields. One approach to understanding the emergence of this response is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory data with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is believed that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across neurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively small number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of sparse coding, coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis, have been proposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the specific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still largely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural representation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism that optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding algorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from natural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding results, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of natural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding is optimized when it is fair. By contributing to optimizing statistical competition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more efficient solution to the emergence of independent components.},

	Abstract = {A motion sequence may be represented as a single pattern in x-y-t space; a velocity of motion corresponds to a three-dimensional orientation in this space. Motion sinformation can be extracted by a system that responds to the oriented spatiotemporal energy. We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion phenomena.},

@article{Tlapale10,
	Abstract = {The dynamics of motion integration show striking similarities when observed at neuronal, psychophysical, and oculomotor levels. Based on the inter-relation and complementary insights given by those dynamics, our goal was to test how basic mechanisms of dynamical cortical processing can be incorporated in a dynamical model to solve several aspects of {2D} motion integration and segmentation. Our model is inspired by the hierarchical processing stages of the primate visual cortex: we describe the interactions between several layers processing local motion and form information through feedforward, feedback, and inhibitive lateral connections. Also, following perceptual studies concerning contour integration and physiological studies of receptive fields, we postulate that motion estimation takes advantage of another low-level cue, which is luminance smoothness along edges or surfaces, in order to gate recurrent motion diffusion. With such a model, we successfully reproduced the temporal dynamics of motion integration on a wide range of simple motion stimuli: line segments, rotating ellipses, plaids, and barber poles. Furthermore, we showed that the proposed computational rule of luminance-gated diffusion of motion information is sufficient to explain a large set of contextual modulations of motion integration and segmentation in more elaborated stimuli such as chopstick illusions, simulated aperture problems, or rotating diamonds. As a whole, in this paper we proposed a new basal luminance-driven motion integration mechanism as an alternative to less parsimonious models, we carefully investigated the dynamics of motion integration, and we established a distinction between simple and complex stimuli according to the kind of information required to solve their ambiguities.},

@article{Watamaniuk95,
	Abstract = {
                Human observers can easily detect a signal dot moving, in apparent motion, on a trajectory embedded in a background of random-direction motion noise. A high detection rate is possible even though the spatial and temporal characteristics (step size and frame rate) of the signal are identical to the noise, making the signal indistinguishable from the noise on the basis of a single pair of frames. The success rate for detecting the signal dot was as high as 90\% when the probability of mismatch from frame-to-frame, based on nearest-neighbor matching, was 0.3. Control experiments showed that trajectory detection is not based on detecting a "string" of collinear dots, i.e. a stationary position cue. Nor is a trajectory detected because it produces stronger signals in single independent motion detectors. For one thing, trajectory detection improves with increases in duration, up to 250-400 msec, a duration longer than the integration typically associated with a single motion detector. For another, the signal dot need not travel in a straight line to be detectable. The signal dot was as reliably detected when it changed its direction a small amount (about 30 deg or less) each frame. Consistent with this, circular paths of sufficiently low curvature were as detectable as straight trajectories. Our data suggest that trajectory motion is highly detectable in motion noise because the component local motion signals are enhanced when motion detectors with similar directional tuning are stimulated in a sequence along their preferred direction.

Inherent delays lead to mislocalization when things move or, more generally, when things change. Errors in time translate into spatial errors when we pursue a moving object, when we try to localize a target that appears just before a gaze shift, or when we compare the position of a flashed target with the instantaneous position of a continuously moving one (or one that appears to be moving even though no change occurs in the retinal image). Studying such diverse errors might rekindle our thinking about how the brain copes with real-time changes in the world.}},

	Abstract = {{Neuronal latencies delay the registration of the visual signal from a moving object. By the time the visual input reaches brain structures that encode its position, the object has already moved on. Do we perceive the position of a moving object with a delay because of neuronal latencies? Or is there a brain mechanism that compensates for latencies such that we perceive the true position of a moving object in real time? This question has been intensely debated in the context of the flash-lag illusion: a moving object and an object flashed in alignment with it appear to occupy different positions. The moving object is seen ahead of the flash. Does this show that the visual system extrapolates the position of moving objects into the future to compensate for neuronal latencies? Alternative accounts propose that it simply shows that moving and flashed objects are processed with different delays, or that it reflects temporal integration in brain areas that encode position and motion. The flash-lag illusion and the hypotheses put forward to explain it lead to interesting questions about the encoding of position in the brain. Where is the 'where' pathway and how does it work?}},

@article{Whitney00-1,
	Abstract = {{A flash that is presented adjacent to a continuously moving bar is perceived to lag behind the bar. One explanation for this phenomenon is that there is a difference in the persistence of the flash and the bar. Another explanation is that the visual system compensates for the neural delays of processing visual motion information, such as the moving bar, by spatially extrapolating the bar's perceived location forward in space along its expected trajectory. Two experiments demonstrate that neither of these models is tenable. The first experiment masked the flash one video frame after its presentation. The flash was still perceived to lag behind the bar, suggesting that a difference in the persistence of the flash and bar, does not cause the apparent offset. The second experiment employed unpredictable changes in the velocity of the bar including an abrupt reversal, disappearance, acceleration, and deceleration. If the extrapolation model held, the bar would continue to be extrapolated in accordance with its initial velocity until the moment of an abrupt velocity change. The results were inconsistent with this prediction, suggesting that there is little or no spatial compensation for the neural delays of processing moving objects. The results support a new model of temporal facilitation for moving objects whereby the apparent flash lag is due to a latency advantage for moving over flashed stimuli.}},

	Abstract = {{The topographic organization of striate cortex in the macaque was studied using physiological recording techniques. Results were displayed on two-dimensional maps of the cortex, which facilitated the quantitative analysis of various features of the visual representation. The representation was found to be asymmetric with more cortex devoted to lower than to upper fields. Over much of striate cortex the representation is anisotropic, in that the magnification factor depends upon the direction along which it is measured. There is considerable individual variability in these features as well as in the overall size of striate cortex. Outside the fovea, the cortical representation shows only modest deviations from a logarithmic conformal mapping, in which the magnification factor is proportional to the inverse of eccentricity in the visual field. Comparison of receptive field size with cortical magnification was used to estimate the "point image size" in the cortex (i.e. the extent of cortex concerned with processing inputs from any given point in the visual field). Our evidence supports a previous report that point-image size varies significantly with eccentricity. This is of interest in relation to anatomical evidence that the dimensions of columnar systems in striate cortex are largely independent of eccentricity.}},

	Abstract = {{We extend the local energy model of position detection to cope with temporally varying position signals and the perception of relative position. The extension entails two main components. First, a form of persistence for the position signal based on the temporal impulse response function of the visual system. Secondly, we hypothesise that the perceived relative position of two objects is determined by a slow average of the difference of the objects' position signals. The model explains why briefly flashed static dots are perceived to lag behind continuously visible moving dots, without the need for a motion extrapolation process [Nijhawan, R. (1994). Nature, 370, 256--257]. The dependence of this illusion on parameters such as the velocity, duration, frequency and number of flashes of the motion trajectories is accurately captured by the model. Furthermore, the model makes two predictions. First, briefly flashed dots on a staircase trajectory should lead dots with a long duration. Secondly, it should be possible to abolish the lag-effect between continuously visible and stroboscopically moving objects by halting the continuously visible dots during the interflash interval of the stroboscopic dots. Both predictions are corroborated in experiments.}},

	Abstract = {{I describe a signal coined position persistence that stores information about the last seen position of an object. Position persistence is not the same as visible persistence, although some of its properties are similar. The duration of position persistence is such that objects visible briefly always generate a position signal for at least 180 ms. The signal is not affected by the intensity of the object, nor of the background. Position persistence decreases with increasing speed, but does not depend on retinal eccentricity. Finally, the persisting signal is not tightly bound to the object that causes it. The signal contains no information on the colour of the object, whereas shape information may become represented after approximately 100 ms. The existence of this signal is interpreted as a psychophysical signature of the parallel processing of visual information.}},

This flash-lag phenomenon reflects a processing advantage for moving stimuli (Metzger, W. (1932) Psychologische Forschung16, 176--200; MacKay, D. M. (1958) Nature181, 507--508; Nijhawan, R. (1994) Nature370, 256--257; Purushothaman, G., Patel, S.S., Bedell, H.E., \&amp; Ogmen, H. (1998) Nature 396, 424; Whitney, D. \&amp; Murakami, I. (1998) Nature Neuroscience 1, 656--657). The present study measures the sensitivity of the illusion to unpredictable changes in the direction of motion. A moving stimulus translated upwards and then made a 90$\,^{\circ}$ turn leftward or rightward. The flash-lag illusion was measured and it was found that, although the change in direction was unpredictable, the flash was still perceived to lag behind the moving stimulus at all points along the trajectory, a finding that is at odds with the extrapolation hypothesis (Nijhawan, R. (1994) Nature370, 256--257). The results suggest that there is a shorter latency of the neural response to motion even during unpredictable changes in direction. The latency facilitation therefore appears to be omnidirectional rather than specific to a predictable path of motion (Grzywacz, N. M. \&amp; Amthor, F. R. (1993) Journalof Neurophysiology 69, 2188--2199).}},

	Abstract = {{In the flash-lag illusion, a flash and a moving object in the same location appear to be offset. A series of psychophysical experiments yields data inconsistent with two previously proposed explanations: motion extrapolation (a predictive model) and latency difference (an online model). We propose an alternative in which visual awareness is neither predictive nor online but is postdictive, so that the percept attributed to the time of the flash is a function of events that happen in the ∼80 milliseconds after the flash. The results here show how interpolation of the past is the only framework of the three models that provides a unified explanation for the flash-lag phenomenon.}},

	Abstract = {{Continuous, predictable events and spontaneous events may coincide in the visual environment. For a continuously moving object, the brain compensates for delays in transmission between a retinal event and neural responses in higher visual areas. Here we show that it similarly compensated for other smoothly changing features. A disk was flashed briefly during the presentation of another disk of continuously changing color, and observers compared the colors of the disks at the moment of flash. We also tested luminance, spatial frequency and pattern entropy; for all features, the continuously changing item led the flashed item in feature space. Thus the visual system's ability to compensate for delays in information about a continuously changing stimulus may extend to all features. We propose a model based on backward masking and priming to explain the phenomenon.}},

	Abstract = {{Experimental findings concerning the properties of the phenomenon of mislocation of brief visual stimuli during smooth eye tracking are described. One of these, which cannot be explained by existing hypotheses, is that under certain conditions the mislocation magnitude tends to have zero or even negative values. A model is developed for explanation of the mislocation phenomenon. It is suggested that localization is based on: (1) information about the current eye position and (2) information about the stimulus locus on the retina. They both arrive at the localization centre with non-zero delays. The mode of information processing in this centre leads to a magnitude of mislocation which is proportional to the difference between the two delays and which could be positive, zero or negative. Factors which influence either delay should also influence the mislocation magnitude.}},

@article{Nijhawan04,
	Abstract = {{There are significant neural transmission and processing delays within the nervous system. How then are behaviours observed both in nature and high-speed ball games, which require temporal accuracy to within several milliseconds, possible? Until recently, most investigators attributed the observed success in interceptive behaviours to learning or prediction built into motor programs that take these delays into account. Several investigators have proposed, however, that sensory mechanisms also contribute to compensation. Sensory compensation is particularly important when moving objects are the targets of interceptive behaviour, as in this case neural delays in the visual system could lead to errors in the communication of crucial position information of the object of interest. However, given the biological significance of visual motion the visual system could have evolved neural pathways optimized for the rapid transmission of motion signals. Alternatively, the visual system could take a sample of visual motion and compensate for the delays through prediction based on the sample. This mechanism is the visual analogue of the previously proposed internal forward model for motor control. We conducted four experiments using the flash-lag effect to ask if the nervous system is naturally geared to processing moving items with a speed greater than stationary flashes. Our results show that the nervous system does not process moving items more quickly than stationary flashes.}},

	Abstract = {{ Moving objects change their position until signals from the photoreceptors arrive in the visual cortex. Nonetheless, motor responses to moving objects are accurate and do not lag behind the real-world position. The questions are how and where neural delays are compensated for. It was suggested that compensation is achieved within the visual system by extrapolating the position of moving objects. A visual illusion supports this idea: when a briefly flashed object is presented in the same position as a moving object, it appears to lag behind. However, moving objects do not appear ahead of their final or reversal points. We investigated a situation where participants localized the final position of a moving stimulus. Visual perception and short-term memory of the final target position were accurate, but reaching movements were directed toward future positions of the target beyond the vanishing point. Our results show that neuronal latencies are not compensated for at early stages of visual processing, but at a late stage when retinotopic information is transformed into egocentric space used for motor responses. The sensorimotor system extrapolates the position of moving targets to allow for precise localization of moving targets despite neuronal latencies. }},

Our motivation was to test a prediction from representational theories of perception (i.e. predictive coding) that primary visual responses should be suppressed by top-down influences during coherent motion. We used a sparse stimulus array such that each element could not fall within the same classical receptive field of primary visual cortex neurons (i.e. precluding lateral interactions within V1). This enabled us to attribute differences, in striate cortex responses, to extra-classical receptive field effects mediated by backward connections. In accord with theoretical predictions we were able to demonstrate suppression of striate cortex activations to coherent relative to incoherent motion. These results suggest that suppression of primary visual cortex responses to coherent motion reflect extra-classical effects mediated by backward connections.}},

Both connections cover portions of V1 representing regions of visual space up to eight times larger than receptive fields as classically defined, though the intrinsic connections are an order of magnitude denser than the feedback. Whereas the intrinsic connections link similarly oriented domains in V1, V2 to V1 feedback displays no such specificity.

Stimuli were centered over the classical receptive field (CRF) and stimulus size was varied from one to four times the diameter of the CRF. Stimulus movies reproduced the spatial and temporal stimulus dynamics of natural vision while maintaining constant CRF stimulation across all sizes. In individual neurons, stimulation of the nCRF significantly increases the information rate, the information per spike, and the efficiency of information transmission. Furthermore, the population averages of these quantities also increase significantly with nCRF stimulation. These data demonstrate that the nCRF increases the sparseness of the stimulus representation in V1, suggesting that the nCRF tunes V1 neurons to match the highly informative components of the natural world.}},

@article{Chacron03,
	Abstract = {{Animals have developed stereotyped communication calls to which specific sensory neurons are well tuned. These communication calls must be discriminated from environmental signals such as those produced by prey. Sensory systems might have evolved neural circuitry to encode both categories. In weakly electric fish, prey and communication signals differ in their spatial extent and frequency content. Here we show that stimuli of different spatial extents mimicking prey and communication signals cause a switch in the frequency tuning and spike-timing precision of electrosensory pyramidal neurons, resulting in the selective and optimal encoding of both stimulus categories. As in other sensory systems, pyramidal neurons respond only to stimuli located within a restricted region of space known as the classical receptive field (CRF). In some systems, stimulation outside the CRF but within a non-classical receptive field (nCRF) can modulate the neural response to CRF stimulation even though nCRF stimulation alone fails to elicit responses. We show that pyramidal neurons possess a nCRF and that it can modulate the response to CRF stimuli to induce this neurobiological switch in frequency tuning.}},

@article{Chen05,
	Abstract = {{ We have investigated how the nonclassical receptive field (nCRF) affects dynamic orientation selectivity of cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) in anaesthetized and paralysed cats using the reverse correlation method. We found that tuning to the orientation of the test stimulus depends on the size of the stimulation area. A significant sharpening of orientation tuning was induced by nCRF stimulation, with the magnitude of the effect increasing with the size of stimulation. The effect of the nCRF on the temporal dynamics of orientation tuning was also investigated by examining the tuning over a range of delays from stimulus onset. We found small but detectable changes in both the preferred orientation and the bandwidth of tuning over time when the classical receptive field (CRF) was stimulated alone. Stimulation in nCRF significantly increased the magnitude of these temporal changes. Thus, nCRF stimulation not only enhances the overall orientation selectivity, but also enriches the temporal dynamics of cortical neurones, which may increase the computational power of the visual cortex in information processing. }},

@article{Ernst99,
	Abstract = {{In many experiments it has been found that stimuli outside the classical receptive-field of orientation-selective cells in the visual cortex can strongly modulate the response properties of these cells. Typically, stimuli with orientation contrasts lead to enhancement, whereas iso-orientation stimuli lead to suppression of the neuronal activity, but these phenomena in general depend in a complicate manner on various parameters like stimulus configuration, contrast, and geometry. In this contribution, we develop a simple theory for such non-classical receptive-field phenomena. We explain the basic mechanisms by a fixed-point analysis. Within this analysis, center-surround experiments can be described by trajectories in parameter space. This allows for a systematic variation of the coupling and stimulation constants. We show that the strength or sign of the enhancement or suppression should not only vary with the experimental paradigm but also with the position of the cell within the cortex. Our results suggest that non-classical receptive-field phenomena are mediated through orientation-specific lateral excitatory interactions.}},
